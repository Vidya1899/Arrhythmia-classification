# Arrhythmia_Multi class classification

Arrhythmia is considered a life-threatening disease causing serious health issues in patients, when left untreated. An early diagnosis of arrhythmias would be helpful in saving lives. This study is conducted to classify patients into one of the sixteen subclasses, among which one class represents absence of disease and the other fifteen classes represent electrocardiogram records of various subtypes of arrhythmias. The research is carried out on the dataset taken from the University of California at Irvine Machine Learning Data Repository.

High level overview:
1. Used standard open source dataset from UCI Repository 
2. Data cleaning 
3. Improved Feature selection and Feature engineering 
4. Novel weighted average method to get the best features to represent the important information in the data
5. Novel Multiclass classification methods to beat the state of art accuracy and achieved 94.2 with medically important features and 95.8 without medically important features
6. Hybrid architecture executed to ensure less computation 
7. Ensemble fusion framework of the output of all the models(like SVM, RF, Deep learning etc) to provide better insights
8. Used different bagging and sampling techniques to get the state of art accuracy
